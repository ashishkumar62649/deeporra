# 09_AGENT_TASKS.md — F Code First-Slice Work Packages

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the first-slice work packages for the F Code project. It divides implementation into discrete, sequentially executable packages that prevent agents from overwriting each other, editing unrelated files, or inventing contracts.

## 2. Implementation Order

```
WP0 → WP1 + WP2 + WP3 → WP4 → WP5 → WP6
```

Some agents may work in parallel only when they edit disjoint owned files.

## 3. Parallel Work Rules

1. No agent may change shared contracts without stopping and reporting with a CHANGE-REQUEST (see `AGENTS.md` Section 18.2).
2. Each agent reads only the docs listed in its work package.
3. Each agent edits only the folders listed in its ownership.
4. Shared files (`fcode/config/`, `fcode/storage/`, `fcode/utils/`) require explicit coordination.
5. When two agents need the same file, the agent that needs it more gets it; the other waits.
6. Conflicts are resolved by the project owner, not by agents guessing.

### Shared Utility Folder: `fcode/utils/`

`fcode/utils/` is owned by the CLI/Config Agent. Other agents may add utility functions only if:
- The utility is used by at least two packages.
- The task report explicitly justifies it.
- No domain-specific package is a better home.

Domain-specific helpers must stay in their domain folders, not `fcode/utils/`.

## 4. Required Docs Before Work

Before any work, agents must read:
- `AGENTS.md` — root rules (especially Sections 18-22)
- `docs/01_CONTEXT.md` — project context, eligibility, freeze rules
- Their specific work package docs (see routing table below)

## 5. Work Package Format

Each work package defines:
- Agent name
- Goal
- Required docs
- Allowed files/folders
- Forbidden files/folders
- Dependencies
- Expected outputs
- Required tests (per test-ownership rules in `AGENTS.md` Section 21)
- Documentation updates
- Completion report

## 11. Work Package 5: Integration (7 steps)

### WP5 Step 1 — Complete

Step 1 established indexing contracts (`IndexCounts`, `IndexDiagnostic`, `IndexRunResult` with validation),
the pure `IndexStateMachine` (no I/O), and updated documentation.

### WP5 Step 2 — Complete

Step 2 implemented `IndexService.build_through_chunking()` — repository validation, scanner invocation,
parser candidate selection with recoverable errors, chunker invocation, all validation, and in-memory
result construction. Ends in CHUNKING state on success. No storage, embeddings, or graph work performed.
See WP5 Step 2 report for full details.

### WP5 Step 3 — Complete

Step 3 extended the pipeline with `IndexService.build_through_graphing()` — embedding input construction,
encoder invocation, embedding-result validation (type, counts, records, vectors, dimensions, paths),
graph builder invocation, graph-result validation (type, nodes, edges, counts, paths, deps), and
embedding/graph diagnostic classification. Fatal error handler `_build_fatal` extended with `chunks`
and `embedding_result` kwargs. Backward-compatible constructor (keyword-only `encoder` and `graph_builder`
parameters). `fcode/embeddings/__init__.py` exports `EXPECTED_DIMENSION`. No storage, persistence, or CLI activation was added in Step 3.

### WP5 Step 4 — Complete

Step 4 added `IndexService.build_through_sqlite_fts()` with keyword-only injected SQLite and FTS dependencies. One fresh state machine runs scan through graph and then enters `STORING` before any write. On a fresh repository scope, repository/status metadata, files, parsed symbols and routes, chunks, and external-content FTS tables are written on the shared SQLite connection in one transaction. Success is intentionally nonterminal (`phase=PERSIST`, `completed_phase=GRAPH`, `persistent_replacement_started=True`). FTS queries resolve to canonical stored chunk evidence. Vector/Chroma writes, graph-store writes, coordinated replacement, old-index deletion, active promotion, `COMPLETE`, and CLI activation remain Step 5 work.

### WP5 Step 5 — Complete

Step 5 added `build_complete_index()` and its thin `run_index()` wrapper. The complete in-memory attempt enters `STORING`, writes SQLite/FTS, local Chroma vectors, and graph rows to an isolated `.fcode/generations/<generation>` directory, verifies the reopened stores, marks the staged status `complete`, and atomically promotes `.fcode/active.json`. The prior active generation remains usable until promotion verification succeeds; failed stages and stale managed staging markers are removed safely. Full rebuild only is supported. Incremental indexing, source edits, hosted services, CLI activation, and Step 6 command exposure remained deferred until Step 6.

### WP5 Step 6 — Complete

Step 6 activates the existing `fcode index [repo]` and `fcode status [repo]` commands. Index lazily composes the accepted local pipeline and calls `run_index()` once. Status is bound to the requested repository, reads only `.fcode/active.json` and its referenced complete generation, and returns canonical persisted counts without scanning, model loading, or workspace mutation. No active index is a healthy status result; invalid active metadata is a sanitized failure.

### WP5 Step 7 — Complete

Step 7 performed the final WP5 acceptance, comprehensive branch audit, targeted verification, full regression, documentation closure, and merge into `main`. All 973 tests pass, the frozen architecture is intact, documentation marks WP5 complete, and WP6 is identified as the next work package. The merged main has been verified under the no-commit merge pattern before committing.

### WP5 — Complete

All seven WP5 steps are complete. The indexing pipeline provides state machine control, repository validation, scanning, parsing, chunking, embedding, graph construction, SQLite/FTS5 persistence, Chroma persistence, graph persistence, isolated staged generations, cross-store verification, safe active-generation promotion, previous-active preservation on failure, and working `fcode index` and `fcode status` CLI commands.

### Next Work Package: WP6

**Required Docs:**
- `AGENTS.md` (Sections 1-22)
- `docs/01_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/03_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/04_DATA_MODEL.md`
- `docs/05_INDEXING_AND_RETRIEVAL.md`

**Allowed Files/Folders:**
- `fcode/indexing/`
- `fcode/contracts/` (read-only imports)

**Forbidden Files/Folders:**
- `fcode/cli/`
- `fcode/storage/` (read-only calls through public interface)
- `fcode/parser/`

- `fcode/chunking/`
- `fcode/embeddings/`
- `fcode/graph/`
- `fcode/mcp_server/`
- `fcode/dashboard/`
- `fcode/retrieval/`

**Dependencies:** WP1 (CLI interface), WP2 (storage modules), WP3 (scanner, parser, graph builder), WP4 (chunker, encoder)

**Expected Outputs:**
- `fcode/indexing/__init__.py`
- `fcode/indexing/state_machine.py` — pure state controller (no I/O)
- `fcode/indexing/index_service.py` — pipeline orchestrator (Step 2: scan→parse→chunk in memory)

**`state_machine.py` contract:**
- `IndexStateMachine` — deterministic state machine with legal forward transitions and ERROR from every non-terminal state
- `InvalidIndexStateTransition` — exception for illegal transitions
- No I/O, no feature-module imports, no filesystem access
- Tracks: state, phase, completed_phase, history (immutable tuple), terminal flag, persistent_replacement_started flag
- Phase A: PENDING; Phase B: SCANNING through GRAPHING; Phase C begins at STORING

**`index_service.py` contract:**
- Orchestrates services only; contains no parser/storage/chunking algorithms
- Controls status transitions (pending → scanning → parsing → chunking → embedding → graphing → storing → complete)
- Controls active-status semantics (Phase A/B preserve existing complete index; Phase C begins destructive replacement)
- Executes cleanup rules on failure
- Maps fatal errors to the error catalog
- Owns the rebuild state machine (Phase A: preflight, Phase B: build in memory, Phase C: persistent replacement)
- Verifies counts before marking complete
- Does not call storage modules directly — calls through public interfaces
- Storage modules do not call each other

**Required Tests:** Cross-module integration tests owned by Tests Agent (WP6). Integration Agent verifies unit tests pass.

**WP5 Step 1 specific tests (owned by Integration Agent):**
- `tests/unit/test_index_state_machine.py` — 64 tests covering initial state, happy path, failure transitions, illegal transitions, public methods, and exception behavior

**WP5 Step 1 contract changes:**
- `IndexCounts` — appended parse_errors, symbols, embedding_eligible, embedding_skipped, embedding_failed, warnings, errors; added `validate()`
- `IndexDiagnostic` — added code, recoverable, repo_relative_path, details fields; phase made optional; added `validate()`
- `IndexRunResult` — state defaults to PENDING; phase defaults to None; added diagnostics list; added `validate()`

**WP5 Step 2 contract changes:**
- `IndexBuildResult` — new dataclass with fields: run_result, completed_phase, state_history, persistent_replacement_started, scan_result, parsed_files, chunks, embedding_result, graph_result
- `fcode/indexing/index_service.py` — new module; `IndexService` class with `build_through_chunking()` only (no `run_index`, `get_status`, `get_counts`)

**Documentation Updates:**
- Update any doc if contracts changed during integration

**Completion Report:**
```
